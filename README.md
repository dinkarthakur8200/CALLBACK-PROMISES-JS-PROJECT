Functions Overview
Double Array Elements:
Function: doubleArrayElements(arr, callback)
Description: Takes an array of integers and a callback function, returning a new array where each element is doubled using the callback.
Manipulating Strings
Manipulate String:
Function: manipulateString(inputstring)
Description: Converts the input string to uppercase and returns a function to log the manipulated string.
Working with Objects
Age in Days:
Function: ageIndays(personobject, callback)
Description: Calculates the age of a person in days and logs the result using a callback function.
Array Operations
Alphabetical Order of Book Titles:
Description: Sorts book titles in alphabetical order and logs them.
Promises
Greeting Promise:
Function: greetingpromise(name)
Description: Returns a promise to greet the user by name.
Asynchronous Data Fetching
Fetch Data Asynchronously:

Description: Fetches data from an API endpoint asynchronously using the fetch API.
Multiple API Data Fetching:

Description: Fetches data from multiple API endpoints asynchronously and combines the results.
Usage
Each code example can be copied and pasted into a JavaScript environment (e.g., Node.js or a browser console) for testing and understanding how the respective functionality works.
